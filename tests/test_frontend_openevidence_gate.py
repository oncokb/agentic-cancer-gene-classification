"""Runs tests/frontend/test_openevidence_gate.js under pytest.

There's no existing JS/frontend test runner in this repo (src/static/app.js
has never had automated coverage before this) — a plain Node script under
tests/frontend/ is the lightest-weight way to exercise app.js's actual
production code (not a Python reimplementation of its gating logic) without
adding a new JS toolchain (package.json, node_modules, a test framework) for
one behavior. See tests/frontend/openevidence_gate_harness.js for how it
loads app.js's declarations into a vm context with a minimal fake DOM.

Proves review gap #1: when settings.openevidence_enabled is off, the
frontend must render no OpenEvidence sidecar card and issue no GET
/v1/genes/{gene}/openevidence request — not just fall back to a runtime
available:false response after a wasted round-trip.
