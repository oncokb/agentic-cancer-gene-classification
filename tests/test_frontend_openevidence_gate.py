"""Runs tests/frontend/test_openevidence_gate.js under pytest.

There's no existing JS/frontend test runner in this repo (src/static/app.js
has never had automated coverage before this) — a plain Node script under
tests/frontend/ is the lightest-weight way to exercise app.js's actual
production code (not a Python reimplementation of its gating logic) without
adding a new JS toolchain (package.json, node_modules, a test framework) for
one behavior. See tests/frontend/openevidence_gate_harness.js for how it
loads app.js's declarations into a vm context with a minimal fake DOM.

Proves review gap #1: when settings.openevidence_enabled is off, the
frontend must render no OpenEvidence sidecar card and issue no GET
/v1/genes/{gene}/openevidence request — not just fall back to a runtime
available:false response after a wasted round-trip.

Also proves the sidecar sends the gene's fusion (annotation.fusions[0], the
same value openevidence_warmup.py warms) as `fusion=` so fusion inputs hit
the backend's fusion-specific cache slot, that fusion and plain-gene lookups
for the same gene don't share a client-side cache entry, and that a fusion
gene still issues zero requests with the flag off.
