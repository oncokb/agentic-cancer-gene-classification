OpenEvidence supplementary evidence lookup.

Off by default (settings.openevidence_enabled). When enabled, this posts a
closed, targeted question — gene classification (+ optional tumor type), or
fusion-partner oncogenicity when the gene is part of a fusion — to
OpenEvidence's streaming analysis endpoint and returns accumulated prose plus
a deduplicated citation list.

This is a SUPPLEMENTARY input to synthesis, not a LiteratureRecord
replacement: OpenEvidence citations are not guaranteed to be PMIDs in the
retrieved literature set, so they must never be passed through
src.pipeline.citation_precision.filter_and_rank_citations or merged into
GeneAnnotation.citations. Callers must always surface this output as clearly
labeled unverified/supplementary evidence.

# guaranteed to end mid-thought with a period.
#
# Two separate places a marker can appear relative to a sentence, both of
# which _split_sentences_with_citation_keys below reads keys from:
#   1. ANYWHERE inside the `sentence` span itself. Real captured prose
#      (benchmarks/results/) has markers mid-clause between words

#      (HR 0.77[[20]]) at the cost of..."), even splitting a single word
#      ("...a matched Japanese registry found sh[[44]]orter 10-year
#      IDFS..."), or directly before the sentence's own terminal
#      punctuation with a preceding space ("ALEX improved PFS [[1]]."). The
#      non-greedy `sentence` group naturally swallows all of these as
#      ordinary characters (none of them contain a [.!?]), so reading keys
#      out of the whole captured span (not a separate sub-group) is what
#      catches them.
#   2. The `trailing_markers` group: a marker run appearing AFTER a
#      sentence's own terminal punctuation but before the next sentence
#      starts — the convention _build_analysis's docstring describes and
#      tests/test_openevidence_sidecar.py's _ALK_ANALYSIS fixture uses:
#      "...median PFS of 34.8 months versus 10.9 months for crizotinib.
#      [[4]] NCCN guidelines recommend...". Case 1 alone would NOT catch
